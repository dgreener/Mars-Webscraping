# Mars Webscraping
The aim of this exercise is to use webscraping in order to extract text and data from a website about Martian weather and then to analyze the weather data. This will be done using our knowledge of different HTML, Splinter for automated browsing and Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing.

## Technical Skills
As part of this exercise, I used the following tools:
  1) Beautiful Soup
  2) Webscraping
  3) Splinter
  4) Pandas
  5) Matplotlib

## Analysis
As part of this analysis, I answered the following questions:
  1) How many months exist on Mars? **12 months**
  2) How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset? **1867 days**
  3) What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? **Month 3 is the coldest and Month 8 is the warmest.**
  4) Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? **Month 6 has the lowest atmospheric pressure and Month 9 has the highest.**
  5) About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? **687 days**
